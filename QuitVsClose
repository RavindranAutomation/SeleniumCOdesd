		 * But most of us have misunderstood that, the current browser window in the
		 * sense which is active and is on focus for the close method. This is not the
		 * case. The close method will close the browser which the driver has focus.
		 * Unless we switch the focus to the newly opened window, the driver has focused
		 * on the old window and the close method will close the old window only not the
		 * newly opened one.
